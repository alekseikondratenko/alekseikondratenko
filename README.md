## Hello, I am Aleksei 👋

Here is some brief information about me:


- ⚡ I’m currently working on AI/ML applications in Civil Engineering as PhD researcher at the Polytechnic University of Milan.
- 🎯 My aim is to use Data Science and Machine Learning to make the World a better place to live.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to deploy ML models on the web/cloud.
- 🌍 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the sustainability (not only in the Civil Engineering industry).
- 😎 I have completed ["Data Scientist in Python path"](https://app.dataquest.io/verify_cert/U6G6VF0P2P9Y07FVDK5W/) from Dataquest.
